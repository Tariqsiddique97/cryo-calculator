1 - I tried it out and it works sort of well. I think it needs a camera button to take the picture and a it needs to be green or red to draw the lines. The flow is not intuitive
2 - I think clicking the length and diameter button should only set it so you&#39;re only filling out those specs not taking the picture. There need to be a live view at 1st.
3 - Also when you hit the set button it takes another picture. It should only set the image with the lines in the form and post the stats

1 - Alright, I’ll work on those adjustments! The green and red lines are working fine on my end. I'll check again. Also could you clarify what you mean by flow is not "intuitive" so I can better understand your vision?

1 - When the pop up modal comes up the camera shutoff be in live view. After clicking the diameter or horizontal button the user should be able to zoom in and draw the green measurement line. Right now I have to use the pan button to move around. Instead of the pan and zoom button switch then out with a green and red circular button labeled as ruler and full measurement. The user can click it to draw the lines then hit apply. When the user types in 6 or 12 that should automatically update the formula. I think it&#39;s one button to many. The apply button can confirm everything and close the popup so the user can finish putting in the rest of the info to get the final scf number
