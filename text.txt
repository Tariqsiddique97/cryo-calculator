All right, so real quick, this

is the HTML mock up that I have.

It is not the latest on the pop

up modal, but it'll give you a

good idea of what I'm trying to

do. So the horizontal tank

fields are hidden unless you

select horizontal tank. And then

once it goes to the pop up modal

and you close it, the tank

diameter and the tank length

are, are populated on the crown

tank calculator. All right,

that's after you click the

horizontal tank. So these two

fields populate if you click on

the horizontal tank or if you

hit the horizontal measure. All

right, so this right here, this

pop up modal is this modal right

here. So when you click

horizontal measure or horizontal

lay down tank, this pop up modal

pops up. And then when you hit

diameter, it will. The way

you're supposed to use it is you

click diameter and then you type

in what size measuring stick

you're going to be using. Either

a 6 inch or a 12 inch. You would

type that in right there. And

then you would go up to the tank

and click. Not click, but stick

a 6 inch ruler or a 12 inch

ruler to the middle of the end

of the tank or to the middle of

the length of the tank and take

a picture. So you click this,

put in 6 or 12, go over to the

tank and put this, a 6 inch

ruler or a 12 inch ruler there

and then back up. So you have

the full length of the tank

either on the diameter side or

on the lint side and take a

picture. Once you take a

picture, then you'll draw a.

You'll zoom in on this, on this

picture right here. You zoom in

on this picture on this image

and draw a green line over the

ruler and then you'll draw a red

line from one end of the tank to

the other on the diameter. If

it's on the length of it, the

ruler will be right here in the

middle. You'll draw one line

over the ruler so that the app

has a basic basis for so you can

extrapolate how, how many pixels

coincide or are mapped with the

size of a 6 inch ruler or a 12

inch ruler. Then they will go

here and mark from one end of

the tank to the other between

the 6 inch or the 12 inch ruler

and the full length. The formula

will tell you how long this tank

is. It will also tell you how

wide the tank is between the

ruler that's on here that's

being measured and the and the

full line that takes up the full

width or length of the, of the

Tank. All right. And then I can

see, I can send you the formula

or not the formula, but the

code. The code is already there.

So it, once that is implemented

into the system it should go

ahead and work. But that

information, once you draw those

lines should give you the full

width, diameter of the tank and

the full length of the tank.

That should populate above the

images with the lines intact.

Both, both lines. That

information should also populate

up here. And then you hit apply

and then that information is put

in here. On tank diameter and

tank length. We have, we will

have the full Trico information

which is already, will already

be populated. That plus these

two, the diameter and the length

plus the full capacity on the,

on the, on the tank and the

starting inches and ending

inches will give you the full

square cubic feet. So if I typed

in full triclok of 100 and the

diameter, let's say is 250. The

length is 2000. Full capacity is

1015,000 gallons. And you can

select whatever gas you want.

Starting inches, let's say 21

ending inches, 25. And if you

hit calculate, that's how you

have put in or dropped 164,000,

no, 16,438 square cubic feet. So

this information here, the

diameter and the, and the tank

length is crucial or central to

this number being accurate.

Without this information and the

full full tricock and full

capacity, this number will not

make sense. It won't, it won't

give you the correct

information. So if you have any

other questions, just let me
