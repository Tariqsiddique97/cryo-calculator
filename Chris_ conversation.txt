Hi Faizan,

I am currently working on a Cryo Calculator that is already close to completion, I’d prefer to have you look at it and possibly help me finish that project first. There are a few remaining items that should be fairly straightforward, and getting that across the finish line is a better fit for where I am right now.

Once the calculator is completed, we can revisit CodeHopper and explore a phased or scaled approach if needed.

I’ve attached a link for you to review the Cryo Calculator so you can provide an estimate on wrapping it up. The main item left is the laydown measurement feature on the pop up modal, which is necessary to accurately calculate SCF based on the tank’s diameter, length, and full trycock level when the tank is positioned horizontally. I have also made some small ui changes to some of the fields to make them fit better on a mobile device. None of the formulas or calculator content need to be changed.

Once you’ve had a chance to look over the current build, please let me know your cost estimate and timeline for completing that final piece.

Best regards,

I completely understand. The full CodeHopper build is indeed a substantial undertaking, and I appreciate you being upfront about where things stand.

I'll review the Cryo Calculator at the link you provided and focus on:

The laydown measurement feature for the popup modal (horizontal tank calculations with diameter, length, and full trycock level)
Any other remaining items to get it production-ready

I'll take a thorough look at the current build today and get back to you

For some reason the measurement lines didn't populate when I saved the figma files. The lines only need to be 2 to 3 pixels thick. I couldn't make them any thinner in Figma for some reason. Let me know if I need to explain how the measurements will work on the horizontal tanks.

Hey Chris,

Just went through everything you sent, the codebase, those screenshots. Good news is you're closer than you might think!

Quick Status Update:

The Photo Measure feature is actually about 80% there. You've got all the heavy lifting done already, camera streaming works, canvas overlay is set up, touch handlers are in place, and the calculation logic is solid.

What I found that needs fixing:

The main issue is the measurement workflow doesn't match what you specified in the PDFs

Right now it's using a 3-point system (C-A-B) where users mark diameter endpoints and needs a known diameter for scale. But looking at your specs, you want the 2-line approach: draw a 12" reference line first, then draw the actual measurement line and calculate based on pixel ratios.

Here's what I need to do:

- Restructure the workflow to match your 2-line system (3-4 hrs)
- Update the calculation logic for the new approach (1-2 hrs)
- Fix the colors - need green start markers + red lines instead of current blue/green (30 mins)
- Test and polish the mobile touch interactions (2-3 hrs)

Timeline: 5-6 hours total work. I can have this wrapped up in 1-2 days

Quick questions before I dive in:

1. Just to confirm - you want the 2-line workflow (12" reference → full measurement), right?
2. Should this handle diameter and length as separate measurements or combined?
3. Any other UI tweaks beyond what's in the screenshots?

Im updating the code for that. I'll send it to you later this evening. Possibly 7 pm cst

I'll need help tweeking the measurements code after that

Sounds good,
Just shoot it over when you're ready and I'll take it from there.

Hi Chris,

I’m working on the following issues for the Cryo Calculator:

1. Restructuring the workflow to match your 2-line measurement system.
2. Updating the calculation logic for the new approach.
3. Fixing the colors to have green start markers and red lines instead of the current blue/green.
4. Testing and polishing the mobile touch interactions.

Total time: 5-6 hours

Let me know if you have any other changes you’d like me to address while I’m on this!

Because the pages are html, if you could make it so if a user closes the page or deviates from page that the information that is type into the fields , stays until the user clears that information out with the clear button that would be great

Make the lines blue and green

I also I don't know if you noticed, but I made some changes to the different fields on each of the pages, like the reserve calculator and the split calculator I chased the size in on some of the bills. If you you could make Change it to the HTML code to match the big one looking.Feel a bit of the entry fields that would be great

Okay got it!

Based on your latest requirements, I'm estimating around 7 hours to address all the issues.
